This Weather App tech test was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React.

Users can submit a query of either a City or Zip/Postal Code and Country Code. The OpenWeather API will then make a first Fetch call to retrieve the Latitude/Longitude, which then is saved into state and calls the main Fetch.
